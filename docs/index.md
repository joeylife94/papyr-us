## Suggested next actions

1. Add an anchor TOC to long documents (e.g., `user-guide.md`, `technical-specification.md`) to enable quick navigation.
2. Consider adding a `docs/README.md` (or expand this index) that includes contribution guidelines for docs edits and image upload process.
3. If you'd like, I can automatically insert a short TOC at the top of the longest docs and create a small PR.
